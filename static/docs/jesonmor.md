# Jeson Mor

Jeson Mor is a two-player strategy board game from Mongolia. It is considered a chess variant. The game is played on a 9 by 9 checkered board. Each player has nine chess knights initially lined up on the players' first ranks. A player wins by being first to occupy the central square (square e5) with a knight without it being captured on the opponent's following turn.
