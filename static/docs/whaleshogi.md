# Whale Shogi

A 6x6 Shogi variant designed by Wayne Schmittberger. In Whale Shogi players have a very weak piece (the *Porpoise*) that if captured gives the capturing player the strongest piece of the game in hand: the *Killer Whale*.

Detailed rules are available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shogi) and the [Chess Variant Pages](https://www.chessvariants.org/shogivariants.dir/whale.html). In this modified version, *Dolphins* (pawns) promote on the last rank and gain the ability to move and capture diagonally backwards.
