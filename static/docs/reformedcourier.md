# Reformed Courier-Spiel

Reformed Courier-Spiel is a revised form of the Medieval Chess game
Courier-Spiel. This version is a modern adaption by Clement Begnis which itself
adapts H. G. Albers modernized rules from 1821. Detailed rules can be found on
the Chess Variant
[Pages](https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/reformedcourier-spiel) and Begnis's
[website](http://clement.begnis.free.fr/). Note that the King castles to the C
and K files and that three new pieces are added: Archer, Champion, and Paladin.
The historical Courier moves as a modern Bishop, and to stay true to the
original spirit of the game, it is shown by a wedge-shaped piece and not as the
modern Bishop.
