# Wildebeest

An 11x10 variant by R. Wayne Schmittberger featuring two long leapers: the
Camel and the Wildebeest. The Camel leaps three squares Rook-wise and then one
square orthogonal to that path and is effectively an extended Knight. The
Wildebeest is a Knight plus Camel compound. The rules may be found on the Chess
Variant [Pages](https://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/wildebeest.html). Note
that in this implementation castling does not feature the flexible castling
rules described above. Castling is only available to the nearest space similar
to standard Chess.
