# Grasshopper King

All the rules of Chess apply except that the King's normal move is replace by that of a [Grasshopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_(chess)) and that stalemate's are a loss for the stalemated player.

Note that because of the asymmetrical King movement it is possible for the Kings to give check and even checkmate to one another.
