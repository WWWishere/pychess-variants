# Kinglet

There is no checking or checkmate. Kings are treated like any normal piece. The winner is the first player to capture all the opponent's pawns or "kinglets."

When reaching the last rank, a kinglet promotes to a king. If a player is forced to promote his last kinglet, the player is then without any kinglets so automatically loses. All pieces including kings are subject to capture. Stalemate is a draw.

Kinglet was invented by V. R. Parton ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._R._Parton#Kinglet_chess)). Rules may also be found on the [Chess Variant Pages](https://www.chessvariants.com/winning.dir/kinglet.html).
