# Loser's Chess

All of the rules of Chess apply except that:

- If it is possible to make a capture move, then you _must_ make a capture move.

- If all of your pieces are taken (you have a lone king), you **win** the game.

- If you are stalemated or checkmated (in the sense of ordinary chess) you **win** the game.
