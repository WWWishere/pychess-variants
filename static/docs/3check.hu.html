<p><em>Check your opponent 3 times to win the game.</em></p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>All the Laws of FIDE chess apply. In particular, a move is legal if and only if it would have been legal in FIDE chess.</li>
<li>If you make a legal move that puts your opponent's King into the third check, you win.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clarification">Clarification</h2>
<p>The winning move has to be legal, e.g. you can not give the third check while in check. Checkmating your opponent is still a legal way to win.</p>
<p>A move is considered to give ONE check if the King is threatened, regardless if multiple pieces are giving the check (in the event of a double check).</p>
